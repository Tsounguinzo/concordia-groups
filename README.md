# concordia-groups

It's really annoying when you can't find a simple group to ask quick questions. Maybe you're stuck on homework, 
forgot where your exam is, or just want to talk about a tough exam. We need study groups for our classes for stuff 
like this.

Concordia-Groups shows that joining these groups should be easy. I made groups on WhatsApp and Discord. 
Discord can be tricky, so not everyone uses it, but WhatsApp is easier for more people.

Concordia-Groups is a tool to help you join study groups easily on WhatsApp or Discord, 
so everyone can get the help they need.

# Are there any other website to do that out there?
No. not for concordia anyways

# I'd love to contribute. Are patches welcome?
